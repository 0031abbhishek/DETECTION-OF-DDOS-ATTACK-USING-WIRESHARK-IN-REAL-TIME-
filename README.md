CONCLUSION:-
This article has presented the Smart Detection system, an online approach to DoS/DDoS
attack detection. The software uses the Random Forest Tree algorithm to classify network
traffic based on samples taken by the sFlow protocol directly from network devices. Several
experiments were performed to calibrate and evaluate system performance. Results showed
that the proposed method is feasible and presents improved performance when compared
with some recent and relevant approaches available in the literature.
The proposed system was evaluated based on three intrusion detection benchmark datasets,
namely, CIC-DoS, CICIDS2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and was able to classify various
types of DoS/DDoS attacks, such as TCP flood, UDP flood, HTTP flood, and HTTP slow.
Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method was compared against recent and
related approaches. Based on the experimental results, the Smart Detection approach
delivers improved DR, FAR, and PREC. For example, in the CIC-DoS and CSE-CICIDS2018 datasets, the proposed system acquired DR and PREC higher than 93% with FAR
less than 1%. Although the system has achieved significant results in its scope, it needs
some improvements, such as a better hit rate among attack classes and an automatic
parameter calibration mechanism that maximizes the detection rate of attacks.
Future works include analysis of DDoS attacks based on the vulnerabilities of services such
as Heartbleed and web brute force attack, enhancement in the multiple-class classification,
self-configuration of the system, developing methods for correlating triggered alarms, and
formulating protective measures.
